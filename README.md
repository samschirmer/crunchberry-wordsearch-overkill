#Crunch Berry Wordsearch Overkill

Okay, so yea, I was standing in the kitchen and eating some Captain Crunch and reading the back of the box. I had just found matching Crunch Berry trees and disregarded the weird tic-tac-toe game since I was alone and didn't think my dogs could offer me a real challenge. 

"There are at least 12 words you can make out of the letters in Crunch Berry. How many can you figure out?"

These are for kids, so I figured I didn't need an actual pen or anything, it should be easy. I'm sure it was a combination of trying to track 12 unique words in my head while simultaneously assembling new words, especially first thing in the morning, but it was way harder than I expected. 

12? Really? They should be asking for like 4, maybe 6. I started to get mad. "Brunch? Wait, did I count that already? Let's start over." 

I got annoyed enough that I figured I'd just solve it entirely, specifically to spite that stupid clown fish that was jumping out of the water in this general section of the box. He has a dumb face that was twisting into a mocking sneer as my frustration level grew. I'd show him. 

I took a wordlist from [a Mozilla project](https://github.com/marcoagpinto/aoo-mozilla-en-dict) and removed all the proper nouns, so if there's something missing, blame them. 

This is one lunch break that I will never get back.
